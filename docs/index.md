# Prism Magician

What is the Magician? The Prism.Magician is a highly specialized development package that works with Prism for WPF, Uno Platform & Xamarin.Forms. With the growing set of Roslyn Analyzers and Code Fixes the Magician is the next best thing to pair programming with Dan & Brian in person.

The Magician is contains a small class library with a number of various attributes that can be used at the Assembly, Class, Method or Property level. Depending on the attribute, the Magician will then use a Code Generation where possible, and IL weaving where necessary to help you write more efficient code.

## Who Can Use It?
